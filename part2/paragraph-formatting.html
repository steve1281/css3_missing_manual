	<p class="extra-high">(The lines in the paragraph will be extra high.) The poem is separated into twelve "books" or sections, and the 
		length of each book varies greatly (the longest being Book IX, with 1,189 lines, and the shortest Book VII, having 640). The 
		Arguments at the head of each book were added in subsequent imprints of the first edition. Originally published in ten books, 
		in 1674 a fully "Revised and Augmented" edition with a new division into twelve books was issued. This is the edition that is 
		generally used today. The poem follows the epic tradition of starting in medias res (Latin for in the midst of things), the	 
       story being recounted later.
	</p>
	<p class="align-center">
	   (The lines of this paragraph will be centered.) Milton's story has two narrative arcs: one is of Satan (Lucifer) and the other is of Adam and Eve. It begins after Satan and 
	   the other rebel angels have been defeated and banished to Hell, or, as it is also called in the poem, Tartarus. In Pand√¶monium, 
	   Satan employs his rhetorical skill to organise his followers; he is aided by Mammon and Beelzebub. Belial and Moloch are also 
	   present. At the end of the debate, Satan volunteers to poison the newly-created Earth and God's new and most favoured creation, 
	   Mankind. He braves the dangers of the Abyss alone in a manner reminiscent of Odysseus or Aeneas. After an arduous traverse of 
      Chaos outside Hell, he enters God's new material World, and later the Garden of Eden.
   </p>	
   <p class="text-indent">
   		The story of Adam and Eve's temptation and fall is a fundamentally different, new kind of epic: a domestic one. Adam and Eve 
   		are presented for the first time[citation needed] in Christian literature as having a full relationship while still being without
   		sin. They have passions and distinct personalities. Satan, disguised in the form of a serpent, successfully tempts Eve to eat from 
   		the Tree by preying on her vanity and tricking her with rhetoric. Adam, learning that Eve has sinned, knowingly commits the same 
   		sin. He declares to Eve that since she was made from his flesh, they are bound to one another so that if she dies, he must also 
   		die. In this manner, Milton portrays Adam as a heroic figure, but also as a greater sinner than Eve, as he is aware that what he 
   		is doing is wrong.
    </p>
    <p class="use-font">
    	After eating the fruit, Adam and Eve have lustful sex, and at first, Adam is convinced that Eve was right in thinking that eating 
    	the fruit would be beneficial. However, they soon fall asleep and have terrible nightmares, and after they awake, they experience 
    	guilt and shame for the first time. Realizing that they have committed a terrible act against God, they engage in mutual 
    	recrimination.
	</p>
	<p class="capital-margins">
		Eve's pleas to Adam reconcile them somewhat. Her encouragement enables Adam and Eve both to approach God, to "bow and sue for 
		grace with suppliant knee", and to receive grace from God. Adam is shown a vision by the angel Michael, in which Adam witnesses 
		everything that will happen to mankind until the Great Flood. Adam is very upset by this vision of humankind's future, and so 
		Michael also tells him about humankind's potential redemption from original sin through Jesus Christ (whom Michael calls "King 
		Messiah").
